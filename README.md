- Eli was raised in Baltimore, and has been in NYC since 2007 (living in 4 of the boroughs), and recently joined the unofficial 6th borough of Boca Raton near his wife's family. After learning the fundamentals in copier sales, he has since been in SaaS sales with early stage to high growth companies for over 8 years. Most recently he had been an Enterprise Account Executive at Segment, and prior to that, at Mixpanel during similar stages of growth. When not listening to the latest tech and business podcasts or reading related topics, Eli prides himself on being somewhat of a politics and professional sports junkie and enjoys playing chess and poker with his social circle.
